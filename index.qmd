## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

::: {#hero-heading .profile-box}
Hi! My name is Mikael and I'm a data analyst/engineer passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. I specialize in building robust data pipelines and conducting complex analyses using R and SQL. Currently, I'm analyzing surgical outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where I apply my expertise to improve healthcare analytics. I'm also the developer of lubrilog, a package available on CRAN. My educational background includes a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Data Science, providing me with a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of data science. When I'm not at work, you can find me watching Dune, Game of Thrones and Survivor!
